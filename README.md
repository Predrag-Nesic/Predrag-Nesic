And now not so formal introduction...

Hi, my name is Predrag Nesic.
I'm from Serbia, city of Belgrade.

Well, I tend to be dirrect... So in order to know me better you can visit my LinkedIn profile...

... or you can check out my repositories. 

<!---
I have a fervent desire to become a prominent programmer.

I have always valued knowledge, effort, or bluntly said hard work. I have cherrished those throughout all my education and life, which i can confirm with my achivements. 
As most of coders these days, my learning started from the simplest, from HTML, that has quickly swithed to basics of CSS and JavaScript. 
For couple of years i wanted to learn programming language that is going to be a strong base form my future career. And I found it in Java. 
I attended beginner and intermediate course here, in Belgrade - Serbia, and I immeditely caught fire. I wanted to learn more, so I started to learn on my own.
A large portion of my free time, mainly off work, was somewhat based on learning new skills in Java programming language. But as most of self-learners, 
I found out that the quickest and most firm way to develope even more is to be a part of an organisation, a team, where i can first learn and, later on, contribute.

For years, since late teenage years, i have worked first as a travel guide for various travel companies from Serbia, and later as a full-time employed travel agent, 
mostly in charge of sales and direct contact with clients. You could say that I got all the necessary skills from the industry. But I got hungry for more knowledge, 
experience and stability.

Since I was a child, I believed that teamwork was extremely important, and I will allways nurture those thoughts. I support this statement with the fact that
I have always been involved in physical education and team sports activities, and during my primary school education I actively trained volleyball for five years. 
I can also state that I have been actively involved in folklore and traditional dances and songs to this day for seventeen years.

Communicative, tolerant, open to cooperation, creative. I always accept criticism and advice from more, or less experienced people, regardless of age,
in order to improve my abilities and experiences. My trump cards are: youth, collegiality, willingness to get involved in any kind of work as well as
enthusiasm for gaining new experiences.

Please feel free to contact me anytime at your convenience, my email is predrag.nesic.stb@gmail.com

I wish you all the best :)...
